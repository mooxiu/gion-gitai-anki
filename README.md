# Gion-Gitai-Anki

This is an Anki project for helping to remember GionGo and GitaiGo in Japanese.

## What is Giongo and Gitaigo?
They both look like an "ABAB" structure:

- Giongo 擬音語: something like わんわん describing things by sound.
- Gitaigo　擬態語: something like ふわふわ describing things by stats/action/feeling.

## How to extend?
- Add new word to `json` file.
- Use the tool to convert to `tsv` format which recognized by Anki.
    ```python
    python3 convert.py
    ```
- Import to Anki.
